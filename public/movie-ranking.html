 <p>This Japanese show talks about fame and ambition, but what really is in it is the inner fights. Each character in the movie has their own stories. What they have to do to get to where they are in life. Mentally and emotionally struggle, and the courage to get up everytime they fall. The resilience push them forward in life. The show takes place of showbiz life, but it relates to many way to almost all of us. Why? Because no life is smooth and noone gets no obstabcle through life. That's just how life is. It will keep throwing lemon at you one after one, and what we can do best is to either develop skills to dogde or catch it. <br/> 
    "Follow thy own road, and let the people talk" - main characters favorite quote<br/> 
    Another reason why I like this show is that it's very different to other trational Japanese' shows. This one is so open about dating life, family, and life style. There is no culture obligation; totally modern. Characters in the show create their own life witht their own rules. Where they get to live as who they are, and honored that. </p>
 <h3>Grave of Fireflies </h3>
 <p>As you know how Ghibli Studio movies are like, they are very good at taking your tears. This movie is not an exception. The story is about when America bombed Japan in WWII and main characters are brother and sister who lost both their parents in war. Their struggle to live through the 1945 war as children with no support. The cold eyes and back turnings from whom they were supposed to call relatives. Despite their situation, their sibling bonds are unbreakable. It's a very meaningful movie for a family night. Prepare your tissue~</p>
 <h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
 <p> Another Ghibli Studio's movie, you just have to see it for yourself! :) </p>
